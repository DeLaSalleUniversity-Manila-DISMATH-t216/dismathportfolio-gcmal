# Week 1
* I was introduced about our course Dismath
* I learned some different terms like:
  * Proposition
  * Mathematical Proff
  * Axiom
  * Logical Deduction
* I learned to use truth table to prove propositions
* I learned different logical connectives like
  * Negation
  * Conjunction
  * Disjunction
  * Exclusive or
  * Conditional
  * Biconditional
* I was also introduced to use logical equivalences
* I found this week a bit challenging because I am having a hard time how to use all of these terms.

# Week 2
*I learned that propositions have subject and predicate.
*I learned the two types of Quantifiers
  * Universal Quantifier
  * Existential Quantifier
*I learned the difference between True and Valid
* I was introduced about the three terms related to rule of innference
  * Argument
  * Valid
  *Fallacy
* I learned the different rules of inference
  * Modus Ponens
  * Modus tollens
  * Hypothetical Syllogism
  * Disjunctive Syllogism
  * Addition
  * Simplification
  * Conjunction
  * Resolution

# Week 3
* I was introduced about the different methods of proof
  * Direct Proof
  * Contraposition
  * Vacuous and Trivial Proof
  * Contradiction
  
# Week 4
* I learned proof of Equivalence by showing p → q and q → p are both true.
* I remembered mathematical induction which was discussed during my Engalg2
* Mathematical Induction has two steps
  * Basic Step
  * Inductive Step
  
# Week 5
* I was introduced about the following
  * Power Series including Geometric Progression and Zeno's Paradox
  * Program Correctness
  * Recursive and Inductive definition
  * Recursive Algorithm
  * Hoare Triple
  
# Week 6
* I was introduced about sets and cadrdiality
* We defined functions and I learned that it is also called mappings/transformations
* We also defined the following
  * Domain - It is a set of real numbers
  * Codomain - It is the set of integers
  * Range - Actual occuring values
- We also discussed the types of functions and these are the following
  * One to One function (Injection)
  * Onto (Subjective)
  * One to One and Onto (Bijection)
