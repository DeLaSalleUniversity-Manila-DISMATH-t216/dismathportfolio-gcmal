dismathportfolio-gcmal created by Classroom for GitHub
# Week 1
* I was introduced about our course Dismath
* I learned some different terms like:
  * Proposition
  * Mathematical Proff
  * Axiom
  * Logical Deduction
* I learned to use truth table to prove propositions
* I learned different logical connectives like
  * Negation
  * Conjunction
  * Disjunction
  * Exclusive or
  * Conditional
  * Biconditional
* I was also introduced to use logical equivalences
* I found this week a bit challenging because I am having a hard time how to use all of these terms.

# Week 2
*I learned that propositions have subject and predicate.
*I learned the two types of Quantifiers
  * Universal Quantifier
  * Existential Quantifier
*I learned the difference between True and Valid
* I was introduced about the three terms related to rule of innference
  * Argument
  * Valid
  *Fallacy
* I learned the different rules of inference
  * Modus Ponens
  * Modus tollens
  * Hypothetical Syllogism
  * Disjunctive Syllogism
  * Addition
  * Simplification
  * Conjunction
  * Resolution

# Week 3
* I was introduced about the different methods of proof
  * Direct Proof
  * Contraposition
  * Vacuous and Trivial Proof
  * Contradiction
  
# Week 4
* I learned proof of Equivalence by showing p → q and q → p are both true.
* I remembered mathematical induction which was discussed during my Engalg2
* Mathematical Induction has two steps
  * Basic Step
  * Inductive Step
  
# Week 5
* I was introduced about the following
  * Power Series including Geometric Progression and Zeno's Paradox
  * Program Correctness
  * Recursive and Inductive definition
  * Recursive Algorithm
  * Hoare Triple
  
# Week 6
* I was introduced about sets and cadrdiality
* We defined functions and I learned that it is also called mappings/transformations
* We also defined the following
  * Domain - It is a set of real numbers
  * Codomain - It is the set of integers
  * Range - Actual occuring values
- We also discussed the types of functions and these are the following
  * One to One function (Injection)
  * Onto (Subjective)
  * One to One and Onto (Bijection)
 
# Week 7 
* During this week, we didn't have any classes.
 
# Week 8
* During the start of this week, we had an introduction about algorithm
* Algorithm is a finite set of precise instructions for performing a computation or for solving a problem.
  * Here are some examples of algorithms we discussed
    * Finding the maximum number in a set of integers
    * Linear Search
    * Binary search

# Week 9
* We further discussed different types of sorting algorithms
  * Bubble Sort - compare adjacent elements then interchange if the pair is in wrong order
  * Insertion Sort - The elements are one by one inserted in correct order.
* We also discussed greedy algorithms and the example about this is a coin problem which chooses the least amount of cost.
 
# Week 10
* During the start of the week, we started discussing growth functions.
  * Types of growth functions
    * Big O Notation
    * Big Omega Notation
    * Big Theta Notation
* Types of time complexity
  * Constant
  * Logarithmic
  * Linear
  * n log n
  * Polynomial
  * Exponential
  * Factiorial
* We also discussed div and modulo operation

# Week 11
* During this week, we didn't have any classes.

# Week 12
* During the start of this week, we started discussing about Graph Theory
  * Terminologies and Concepts to understand
    * Graph - consists of vertices and edges that are connectec to each other
    * Degree - The number of edges connected in a node
    * Path -  sequence of edges that begins at a vertex of a graph and travels from vertex to vertex along edges of the graph.
    * Handshake Theorem - Computes the number of edges in a graph
      * Handshake Formula - 2e = summation of degree per node
    * Euler Circuit - all edges must be passed only once and must be able to return to the intial position.
    * Euler path - all edges must be passed only once.
    * Euler Circuit contains even degree in all of its nodes.
    * Euler Path contains exactly two odd degrees in its nodes.
    * Pendant - a node with one degree.
    * Hamilton Circuit - all nodes must be passed only once and must return to the intial position.
    * Hamilton Path - all nodes must be passed only once.
    * Isomorphic - two graphs that have one to one correspondences.
    * Planar - no edges having to cross
    * Formula for regions - r= e - v + 2
    * Kuratowski Theorem - Having a K3,3 and K5 graphs is automatically non planar.

# Week 13
* During the start of this week, we discussed a tree
  * Tree is undirected graphs without a circuit.
  * A rooted tree is a tree in which one vertex has been designated as the root and every edge is directed away from the root.
  * m-ary trees were also discussed
* Graph Coloring
  * Assigning colors to every vertices. No adjacent vertices must have the same color.
  * Chromatic number - minimum numbers of colors that can be used in graph coloring.
* Modeling Computation
* Finite-state machines
