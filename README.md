# Week 1
* I was introduced about our course Dismath
* I learned some different terms like:
  * Proposition
  * Mathematical Proff
  * Axiom
  * Logical Deduction
* I learned to use truth table to prove propositions
* I learned different logical connectives like
  * Negation
  * Conjunction
  * Disjunction
  * Exclusive or
  * Conditional
  * Biconditional
* I was also introduced to use logical equivalences
* I found this week a bit challenging because I am having a hard time how to use all of these terms.

# Week 2
*I learned that propositions have subject and predicate.
*I learned the two types of Quantifiers
  * Universal Quantifier

  * Modus tollens
  * Hypothetical Syllogism
  * Disjunctive Syllogism
  * Addition
  * Simplification
  * Conjunction
  * Resolution

# Week 3
* I was introduced abouth the different methods of proof
  * Direct Proof
  * Contraposition
  * Vacuous and Trivial Proof
  * Contradiction
  
# Week 4
* I learned proof of Equivalence by showing p → q and q → p are both true.
* I remembered mathematical induction which was discussed during my Engalg2
* Mathematical Induction has two steps
  * Basic Step
  * Inductive Step
